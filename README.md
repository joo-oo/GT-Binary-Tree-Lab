Does it live on land? -> Is it a mammal? -> Is it a Crab? -> Is it a Dolphin? -> Is it a pet? -> Is it a Lion? -> Is it a Dog? ->

Is it a Crab? -> Is it a mammal? -> Is it a Dolphin? -> Does it live on land? -> Is it a Lion? -> Is it a pet? -> Is it a Dog? -> 

--- Post-Order Traversal (Left -> Right -> Root) ---
Is it a Crab? -> Is it a Dolphin? -> Is it a mammal? -> Is it a Lion? -> Is it a Dog? -> Is it a pet? -> Does it live on land? ->])
